    <h1>A webpage made for a class</h1>
    <h2>to review and/or get used to various basic html tags</h2>

    <p>This is <i>not</i> actually my first webpage</p>
    <p>I don't anticipate much pride in it, but maybe if I work hard enough it will actually be nicer than anything I made in 1999...</p>

    <p>The following are some of the things we'll go over in this class</p>
    <ul>
      <li>HTML</li>
      <li>CSS</li>
      <li>JavaScript</li>
      <li>markdown</li>
      <li>stuff about git</li>
      <li>and so on</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Pressing Questions:</b></p>
    <ol>
      <il>Can I edit a git commit message that I structured incorrectly?!</li>
    </ol>
